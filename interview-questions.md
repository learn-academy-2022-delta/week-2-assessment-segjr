# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: The difference is that a parameter is a temporary variable and an arguement is a permanent object in a function. The former is temporary and plugged into a function. The letter is a part of the function that helps it run. A parameter would be considered a value that is passed through a function. An argument would be considered an object inside the function, that typically utilizes the parameter. It would be equivalent to food, organs and the human body. Food represents the parameter; Organs represent arguments that use food for the body; The body represents the function. 

  Researched answer: Parameters are properties of a function, whereas arguments are the properties of a specific call to a function. Similar to functions and methods, parameters and arguments basically function the same, but in different scopes. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map() uses an array, an index, an index value and a modified index value. Only the current index value is required, as it will be applied to the array that .map is called to. The array, index and modified index value are all optional.

  Researched answer: The .map() method only requires a function definition as a parameter. The function will be called for each element in the array. The other parameters arent necessary for the .map() method to run.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: The map method will return an array with the same index as the calling array. The filter method will return an array with its own index, depending on the function applied to the calling array. 

  Researched answer: The map method will apply a function to the array, in turn, creating a new array from the applied function. The filter method does not alter the original array, but instead takes certain elements from that array and returns them in a new array.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a call to perform a task. A method is, essentially, a function that only works with objects. The main difference is the scope they operate in. 

  Researched answer: There are many differences between functions and method. The ones that stand out are: they both use different syntax to operate, a function is its own block of code and a method is associated with an object's code, functions operate on any parameters and methods only operate on the parameters provided by the class, functions can be called directly by name and methods can only be called by dot notation, square brackets or the name of its corresponding object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is transforming values from objects into variables. It uses curly brackets to modify keys or values into variables in reference to an object. It also modifies multiple properties at once. 

  Researched answer: The process of extracting data from objects and assigning them to variables. It uses variable declaration, variables, and objects as parameters. It can also be used to assign values to variables that do not have an existing key within the object.  



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Hoisting refers to the process of declarations being moved to the top of the current scope before code is executed. Coincidentally, I discovered this definition when trying to discover important concepts of javascript, prior to LEARN Academy. 

  Researched answer: Hoisting is a default behavior in javascript. A benefit is that it allows functions and variables to be called before they are scripted. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: The process of reusing the properties and/or methods of an existing class, as well as adding to those properties/methods.

2. React: A javascript library for building and utilizing user interfaces 

3. React state: An object containing set values that pertain to, or control, the component. 

4. React lifecycle methods: Mounting, updating and unmounting methods built into React that are used to monitor or manipulate components. 

5. DOM: The Document Object Model is essentially a collection of objects of a document that can be manipulated using javascript. The DOM also refers to those objects being defined in a descending logical tree, depending on classification.
